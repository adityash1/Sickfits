# Sickfits
This project is a full-stack application built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Keystone](https://keystonejs.com/). It leverages the power of these technologies to deliver a high-performance, scalable, and maintainable application.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, you need to run the development servers for both the frontend and the backend.

For the frontend, navigate to the frontend directory and run:

```
npm run dev
or
yarn dev
or
pnpm dev
```


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js` or `pages/index.tsx` depending on your setup. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

For the backend, navigate to the backend directory and run:
```
yarn dev
```

This will start the Keystone server.
